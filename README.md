# Rustlings

This repository stores my progress working through [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) (v6.0.1).

Every completion of an exercise will be committed. The commit will include an exercise file (modified by me) and a solutions file (filled in by rustlings). If a solutions file is not filled in, it means I have not attempted the exercise yet.
